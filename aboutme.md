<p style="text-align: center;"> I am Anudeep <br> I code and play basketball <br> Also game maybe? <br> <br> (Try Googling "Haiku" &#128541;) </p>

I'm Anudeep Tubati and I'm currently a CS Senior at [IIT Dharwad](https://iitdh.ac.in/), India (if I'm not there by the time you're reading this, I've clearly procrastinated blogging, yet again &#128532;).

Oh, you're still reading? _Thenks_ for showing so much interest\
For starters, I'm from Hyderabad, Telangana, India ([best city](https://www.thehansindia.com/telangana/hyderabad-ranks-best-city-to-live-in-india-for-fifth-time-in-a-row-511940) in India, duh).

Favorite quotes? I usually love a lot of quotes, have a whole collection of 'em. However, there are 2 particular quotes which blow my mind everytime I read them.
> A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor. &mdash; Franklin D. Roosevelt\
> We accept the love we think we deserve. &mdash; Stephen Chbosky, [The Perks of Being a Wallflower](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1659337/)
